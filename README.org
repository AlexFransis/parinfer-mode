* What is Parinfer?
[[https://github.com/shaunlebron/parinfer][Take a look at this]]

* Installation
Available on Melpa(and Melpa Stable) now, I recommand to install with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] .
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Require parinfer with use-package.
  (use-package parinfer
    :ensure t
    :bind
    (;; Use this to toggle Indent/Paren Mode.
     ("C-," . parinfer-toggle-mode)
     ;; Some other commands you may want.
     ("M-r" . parinfer-raise-sexp)
     ("M-m" . mark-sexp)
     ("M-j" . parinfer-transpose-sexps)
     ("M-k" . parinfer-reverse-transpose-sexps))
    :init
    ;; Enable Parinfer for Emacs Lisp and Clojure.
    (progn
      (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'parinfer-mode)
      (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'parinfer-mode)))
#+END_SRC

* Work on Cider REPL?
Not yet.

* Toggle Indent and Paren mode.
Use ~parinfer-toggle-mode~.

I recommand to add a keybinding for ~parinfer-toggle-mode~, since it will be used frequently.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key parinfer-mode-map (kbd "C-,") 'parinfer-toggle-mode)
#+END_SRC
When the first time, you switch to Indent Mode, if your code will be modified by parinfer,
You will see a confirm message in minibuffer. Type ~y~ for continue, ~n~ to stay in paren mode.

Use ~parinfer-diff~ to see how parinfer will change the buffer with Ediff.

[[file:screenshots/diff_demo.gif]]

Normally, after indenting the whole buffer with ~C-x h~ ~C-M-\~, you can switch to Indent Mode safely.

* Work with Evil?
Parinfer mode only works in insert-state.

But there's already a plugin called [[https://github.com/luxbock/evil-cleverparens][evil-cleverparenjs]] , that handles parentheses nicely for evil normal or visual states.

If you are using evil, try using ~evil-cleverparens~ + ~parinfer-mode~ .

* Performance.
On each text modification, the current top-level form will be computed. 
When switching to Indent mode, whole buffer will be computed. 
No performance issue now.

* Hooks?
~parinfer-mode-enable-hook~ and ~parinfer-mode-disable-hook~.

* Preview cursor scope?
Not support yet.
