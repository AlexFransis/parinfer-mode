* WIP
Work in progress, may not satble. 
I use this for my Clojure code and it just works.
But there's some bugs for compute the indentation for Emacs Lisp code.
So Seriously, *DO NOT USE THIS IN emacs-lisp-mode*.

* What's parinfer?
[[https://github.com/shaunlebron/parinfer][Take a look at this]]

* Installation
Currently not available on melpa now, so if you want try this, 
you have install it manually.
** This rely on 
** Clone this repo.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cd /some/path/parinfer-mode
  git clone https://github.com/DogLooksGood/parinfer-mode.git
#+END_SRC
** Emacs configurations.
This plugin rely on [[https://github.com/Malabarba/aggressive-indent-mode][aggressive-indent-mode]]. So you have to install it and do *NOT* enable it.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/some/path/parinfer-mode")
  (require 'parinfer)
#+END_SRC
** Enable parinfer-mode for Clojure.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'parinfer-mode)
#+END_SRC
Not work in Cider REPL now.

* Toggle Indent and Paren mode.
Use ~toggle-parinfer-mode~, default bind to ~C-9~.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key map (kbd "C-9") 'toggle-parinfer-mode)
#+END_SRC

* Work with Evil?
Not yet, some work is needed.

* Hooks?
~parinfer-mode-enable-hook~ and ~parinfer-mode-disable-hook~.

* Preview cursor scope?
Not support yet.
