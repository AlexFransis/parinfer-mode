* Screenshots

* WIP, use with your own risk.
Work in progress, may not satble. 
I use this for my Clojure and Emacs Lisp code.

* What is Parinfer?
[[https://github.com/shaunlebron/parinfer][Take a look at this]]

* Installation
Currently not available on melpa, so if you want try this, 
you have install it manually.
** Clone this repo.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cd /some/path/parinfer-mode
  git clone https://github.com/DogLooksGood/parinfer-mode.git
#+END_SRC
** Emacs configurations.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Add parinfer-mode to load-path.
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/some/path/parinfer-mode")

  ;; Require it!
  (require 'parinfer)
#+END_SRC
** Enable parinfer-mode.
~M-x parinfer-mode~

or
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'parinfer-mode)
  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'parinfer-mode)
#+END_SRC
Not work in Cider REPL now.

* Toggle Indent and Paren mode.
Use ~toggle-parinfer-mode~, default bind to ~C-9~.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key map (kbd "C-9") 'toggle-parinfer-mode)
#+END_SRC
When the first time, you switch to Indent Mode, if your code will be modified by parinfer,
You will see a confirm message in minibuffer. Type ~y~ for continue, ~n~ to stay in paren mode.

Use ~parinfer-diff~ to see how parinfer will change the buffer.

[[file:screenshots/diff_demo.gif]]

Normally, after indenting the whole buffer with ~C-x h~ ~C-M-\~, you can switch to Indent Mode safely.

* Work with Evil?
Not yet, some works are needed. Will come soon.

* Performance.
On each text modification, the current top-level form will be computed. 
When switching to Indent mode, whole buffer will be computed. 
No performance issue now.

* Hooks?
~parinfer-mode-enable-hook~ and ~parinfer-mode-disable-hook~.

* Preview cursor scope?
Not support yet.
